### Dice Counter Using OpenCV & Python


#### This project counts the number of dice pips that appear in a video feed.

To accomplish this it uses OpenCV's *SimpleBlobDetector*. 

As written it simply prints the dice total in the console, but it could be modified to host a board game, trigger some event, etc.
